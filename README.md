🍽️ Delicious Bites Catering — Catering Website (Sample Project)

This is a fictional catering business website I created as part of my web development journey. 
It’s a static, fully responsive site designed to showcase a small business’s offerings, contact details, and branding in a clean and modern layout.

🧠 About the Project

This sample project was made to apply and demonstrate my skills in building real-world business websites. 
From structuring content to styling and making the layout responsive, this project helped me improve how I handle one page designs and optimize for user experience.
